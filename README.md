# My Favorite CMD Commands

## ls - List directory contents

The ```ls``` command allows you to quickly view all files within the specified directory.


## touch - Creates Files

You can create with ```touch``` as many files as you want in a single command without worrying about overwriting files with the same name.


## pwd — Print working directory

This ```pwd``` command is used to print the current directory you’re in. As an example, if you have multiple terminals going and you need to remember the exact directory you’re working within, then pwd will tell you.
